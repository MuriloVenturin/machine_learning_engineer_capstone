    "\n",
    "A support vector machine (SVM) is a concept in computer science for a set of supervised learning methods that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis. The standard SVM takes a set of data as input and predicts, for each given input, which of two possible classes the input is part of, which makes SVM a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or another. An SVM model is a representation of examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples in each category are divided into a clear space that is as wide as possible. The new examples are then mapped into the same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the space they are placed on.\n",

    "Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.\n",

    "\n",
    "The descent of the stochastic gradient (SGD usually abbreviated) is an iterative method to optimize an objective function with suitable smoothness properties (for example, differentiable or subdifferentiated). It can be considered a stochastic approximation of the gradient descent optimization, since it replaces the current gradient (calculated from the entire data set) with an estimate of it (calculated from a randomly selected subset). Especially in big data applications, this reduces the computational load, achieving faster iterations in commerce, for a slightly lower convergence rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.4.  Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree learning is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. It uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to move from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the target value of the item (represented in the leaves). Tree models in which the target variable can receive a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, the leaves represent class labels and the branches represent sets of resources that lead to these class labels. Decision trees in which the target variable can take continuous values (usually real numbers) are called regression trees.\n",
